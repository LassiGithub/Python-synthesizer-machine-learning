# Demo and viewing the project

You can listen to sound samples of how the model predicts here: https://lassigithub.github.io/Python-synthesizer-sound-samples/  
You can view the project itself by clicking on the jupyter notebook file: "python_synthesizer_machine_learning.ipynb"  

# Description

This is a machine learning project using my previously made python synthesizer.  
That project can be viewed here: https://github.com/LassiGithub/Python-synthesizer  

The synthesizer creates a sound based on given parameters.  
In this project, I teach a neural network to predict those parameters based on the synthesized sound.  
I've done the machine learning using keras.   

The sound samples webpage contains many predictions made by the trained model.  
If you want to just see how well the model works, you can listen to those.  

The jupyter notebook file here contains descriptions about the data, model, and training.  
The code for the creation and training of the model is included here.  

However, the code for generating the data is actually included in the original python synthesizer project.  
Similarly, the predictions using the model are made there.  
This is because the synthesizer itself is implemented there, which made it simpler to do things this way.
